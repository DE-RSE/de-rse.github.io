# Not found (404)

We have changed the way that blog posts are displayed.

If following a link got you here, and you were expecting to find a blog post, you can try to manually add the post language, and change the `.html` suffix to a slash `/`.

## Examples:

If the URL in your browser is  
`https://de-rse.org/blog/2017/03/22/welcome-to-the-de-rse-blog.html`  
change it to  
`https://de-rse.org/en/blog/2017/03/22/welcome-to-the-de-rse-blog/`.

Similarly,  
`https://de-rse.org/blog/2017/03/22/willkommen-beim-de-rse-blog.html`  
would become
`https://de-rse.org/de/blog/2017/03/22/willkommen-beim-de-rse-blog/`.

## Other errors

Please [add an issue](https://github.com/DE-RSE/de-rse.github.io/issues) if you think there should be something else here instead of this error page. Thanks!
