Hello,

Do you develop research software, or are you involved in the scientific
software creation process? Then we would very much like you to
participate in the following survey:

[https://softwaresaved.limequery.com/661559?lang=en](https://softwaresaved.limequery.com/661559?lang=en)

As of now there is not much knowledge about the community of those in
research and science who develop software. This survey aims to gain
valuable insights into this community in order to support research
funders and other institutions to develop strategies and funding
programs as well as policies.

This survey gives you the opportunity to make your point of view and
experiences be heard, and thus be part of the development of this community.

In case you know others who develop software in research, please feel
free to forward this invitation. If you forward this mail to a mailing
list, please be so kind and copy in Martin (janosch@mpi-cbg.de) and
Stephan (martin.hammitzsch@gfz-potsdam.de).

The survey results will be published under a CC BY-NC license, and will
be announced and evaluated via the [de-RSE mailing list](http://www.de-rse.org/en/join.html) and the
[de-RSE blog](http://www.de-rse.org/en/blog.html). Simultaneously, similar surveys are conducted in the
UK, Canada, Australia, Norway, the Netherlands, the USA and South
Africa. For reasons of comparability, this survey was closely
coordinated with the others.

We look forward to your participation in the survey!

Many thanks,
Martin Hammitzsch and Stephan Janosch
