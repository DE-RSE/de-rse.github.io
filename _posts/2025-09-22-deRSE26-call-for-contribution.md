We're delighted to announce 
that [deRSE26, the 6th conference for Research Software Engineering in Germany](https://events.hifis.net/event/2945/), will be 
hosted at the University of Stuttgart from the 3rd to the 5th March 2026.

The [call for contributions](https://events.hifis.net/event/2945/abstracts/) will open on September 22. 
We encourage you to submit an abstract, whether you are from academia or industry, a student or an employee, a first-time presenter or a seasoned RSE. 
If your contribution addresses a topic that you think is of interest to the community of people concerned with research software, we would love to see it submitted!

We use the Indico platform to manage conference registration and abstract submission. These operations are decoupled from each other, i.e. abstract submission doesn't automatically register you. You can use Helmholtz AAI to create an account through your institution, GitHub, Google, or ORCID.

We plan to publish a post-conference proceedings volume on the deRSE26 conference. Contributors to deRSE26 will be invited to submit a journal-length version of their contribution to this volume after the conference. Submissions will be peer-reviewed and, if accepted, published in the open-access journal ECEASST (https://eceasst.org/index.php/eceasst) at no cost to the authors.

Please don't hesitate to contact the orga team, derse26@listserv.dfn.de, if you have any questions.

We are looking forward to welcoming you in Stuttgart next March!
