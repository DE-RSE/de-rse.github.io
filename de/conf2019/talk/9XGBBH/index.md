Libraries have been supporting research for centuries. They help you find interesting information, provide trainings, help you publish your research and archive most of it. Librarians are specialists in information indexing, resource descriptions and metadata management. In sum, libraries act as generalists who support the specialists. This workshops will connect librarians and RSEs in order to tackle current problems in research software discovery, training, archiving and publishing. We will show where libraries are already supporting research software and its developers and identify future work.
