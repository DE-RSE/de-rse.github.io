# Building scientific communities - Lessons learned with AIRR

## [Christian Busse](../../speaker/XLFA8F/)

AIRR-seq (Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing) data is a special subtype of genome sequencing data, which is assumed to be representative of an individual's immune status and therefore holds large promises for biomedical research. The AIRR Community was founded in 2015 with the goal to foster the exchange of AIRR-seq data by making it FAIR and available under free/open licenses. It is an international group that assembles researchers and practitioners from all disciplines involved in generating, processing and interpreting this data: Biology, informatics, data science, medicine and law. In this talk I will summarize the main lessons we learned in the process of establishing the community and setting and reaching its goals.
