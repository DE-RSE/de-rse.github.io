Please note that the mailing list currently only accepts mails smaller than
40kB, which should be sufficient for text. If you like to point to other
content, please upload it to an external place and include the URL in the email.
The reason for this limitation is not only general courtesy towards all
recipients, but also that otherwise traffic generated by the mailing list could
create a financial problem.

## Monthly Community Call

In the December Call of the German-speaking 
[OKF working group Open Science](http://www.ag-openscience.de/) in 2016 
it has been agreed to combine the monthly call with the de-RSE initiative at the 
beginning of 2017. Both topics, Open Science and Research Software Engineering, 
are closely related, pursue goals with a common set of interfaces, and address a 
similar circle of interested parties.

A monthly call is also considered for the de-RSE initiative, but for now both calls are held jointly.

Dates and times for the monthly community calls are [listed here](https://pad.okfn.de/p/openscience-ag-master-pad).

## Blog

The website hosts a blog with contributions from the community members.
Your ideas, topics and posts in German, English, or both are very welcome!
The `README` includes instructions for getting a local preview of the site.
