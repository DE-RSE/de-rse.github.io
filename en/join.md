Please note that the mailing list currently only accepts mails smaller than
40kB, which should be sufficient for text. If you like to point to other
content, please upload it to an external place and include the URL in the email.
The reason for this limitation is not only general courtesy towards all
recipients, but also that otherwise traffic generated by the mailing list could
create a financial problem.

## Chat: Matrix

Please don't use the mailing list for long discussions, use the chat channel(s) instead!
You can find a list of these channels and some information on how to start using Matrix chat on a [separate page](matrix.html).

## Job offers

Job offers can be announced through the following channels:
- Matrix channel: <https://matrix.to/#/#de-rse.org-jobs:matrix.org>
- Mailing list (please start you subject line with "[JOBS]", for example "[JOBS] permanent position as RSE group leader")

## Monthly Community Call

Since 2017, we host a monthly "Open Science" call together with the
[OKF working group Open Science](http://www.ag-openscience.de/). During this call,
topics from OpenScience to RSE and beyond are discussed informally by the community.

Dates and times for the monthly community calls are [listed here](https://pad.okfn.de/p/openscience-ag-master-pad).

## Blog

The website hosts a blog with contributions from the community members.
Your ideas, topics and posts in German, English, or both are very welcome!
The [README.md](https://github.com/DE-RSE/de-rse.github.io/blob/master/README.md) includes instructions for getting a local preview of the site.

## Local RSE groups
