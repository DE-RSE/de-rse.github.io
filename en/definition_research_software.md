# Definition Research Software

At the moment, there is no single universally used or accepted definiton of research software.
This is not for a lack of effort.
A lot of discussions happend and still happen on this topic and so far resulted in a few definitons that all go in roughly the same direction, but put more emphasis on one or the other aspect.
We are involved in those discussions as de-RSE e.V., but we did not (yet) single out a specific definition, but for the time being collect there what we consider some of the most often used definitions.

## from: “Defining Research Software: a controversial discussion”

A Summary Report of FAIR4RS Subgroup 3 activity and discussion, available on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/5504016).

_Research Software includes source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows and executables that were created during the research process or for a research purpose.
Software components (e.g., operating systems, libraries, dependencies, packages, scripts, etc.) that are used for research but were not created during or with a clear research intent should be considered software in research and not Research Software.
This differentiation may vary between disciplines._

This definition was also used in

- the [Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability](https://zenodo.org/records/8325436)
- the [FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles)](https://zenodo.org/records/6623556), an RDA recommendation

## from: “UK Research Software Survey 2014”

Available on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14809).

_Software that is used to generate, process or analyse results that you intend to appear in a publication (either in a journal, conference paper, monograph, book or thesis).
Research software can be anything from a few lines of code written by yourself, to a professionally developed software package.
Software that does not generate, process or analyse results - such as word processing software, or the use of a web search - does not count as ‘research software’ for the purposes of this survey._

## from: “Research Software – Quality Assured and Re-usable”, a call for proposals to increase the usability of existing Research Software by the DFG

Available from the [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/en/news/news-topics/announcements-proposals/2022/info-wissenschaft-22-85).

_Nowadays, the use of software is an integral part of research work in almost all disciplines.
Typical areas of application include the generation, processing, analysis and visualisation of research data and, especially in the natural sciences and engineering, the control and execution of experiments.
If software is developed for this purpose in the context of research, it is referred to as research software._

## from: “Research Software Sustainability”, a call for proposals by the DFG.

Available from the [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/resource/blob/172676/861b6b46e50aef649ee6634c7a2d0b6a/161026-dfg-call-proposal-software-en-data.pdf).

_In every phase of scientific work, many disciplines use research software, for example to
generate, process, analyse and visualise research data.
In this sense, the term “research
software” refers to the software applications and software libraries specially created for
scientific knowledge gain._
