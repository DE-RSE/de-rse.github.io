## Membership

There are currently three types of memberships: **Ordinary Member**, **Supporting Member**, and **Institutional Member**.

### Ordinary Member

An ordinary membership is the most suitable format in most cases. As an ordinary member, you pay an annual membership fee, have voting rights, and receive the benefits of regular members (currently including discounted membership in the German Informatics Society and usually reduced participation fees for de-RSE-related events). By becoming a member, you support the association and can more actively participate in discussions.

The current fee for ordinary membership is **€60/year**. <!---If your employer is an institutional member of the association, the annual fee is reduced to **€45/year**. --->For students, pupils, unemployed persons, trainees, retirees, people with disabilities, or those who are simultaneously members of the German Informatics Society, a reduced fee of **€30/year** applies.
