# Positions

As *de-RSE e.V. - Society for Research Software*, we develop and take positions on different aspects of research software, and on topics that affect the people, groups, structures and institutions involved in research software. In doing so, we take the viewpoint of a heterogeneous community, which includes Research Software Engineers across the spectrum of roles and concepts, and represent them in the public discourse.

Our positions are developed in [open community processes](#development-process), which are actively shaped by our members. This process model includes open calls for collaboration, collaborative development, and open review processes upon which decisions are based.

When members of de-RSE e.V. represent the Society in public, they take the accepted positions in relevant discourse.

## Work in progress

The following positions are currently developed.

## Development process

The development process for positions of the Society has been developed by its members and can be changed by its members if the need arises. It has three phases, which are set up as follows.

### 1. Call and work phase

1. **Call for Collaboration:** Initiators of a position announce the topic on the Society's mailing list (list@de-rse.org, with subject `[Call for contributions]`), and invite all members to collaborate. The call names main authors of the position text, and explains the prerequisites for authorship.
2. **Collaboration:** Collaboration starts on a - preferably public - platform of the initiators' choice (\*Pad, repository, hackmd.io, Overleaf, etc.). At the same time, the project is presented and linked to on the de-rse.org website under ["Positions" > "Work in progress"](https://de-rse.org/en/positions.html#work-in-progress).

### 2. Review phase

1. **Publication:** Once a draft is deemed ready for publication, it is published for review:
    - If the position is to be published on the de-RSE website under "Positions", a respective pull request (PR) is created against <https://github.com/DE-RSE/www>.
    - If the position is to be published in another format, a respective issue is created on <https://github.com/DE-RSE/projekte>, which contains a link to the draft.
2. **Call for reviews:** The draft publication is announced on the mailing list (liste@de-rse.org, with subject `[Call for Reviews]`), and the link to the respective issue/PR is provided. All members are invited to review the draft until a suitable date.
3. **Reviews:** Members review the draft publicly in the PR/issue. Should the draft initiate a controversial discussion, the PR/issue is marked with the label `[Kontroverse]`. Controversial discussions/reviews are those which, in a peer review process, would lead to a rejection or "major revision" decision.

### 3. Decision phase

1. **Decision:** The board decides if the developed position is to be classified as an "official" position of de-RSE e.V. - Society for Research Software:
    - When review discussions are not labeled as controversial, decisions on a position are made by at least one member of the board.
    - When review discussions are labeled as controversial, the board aims to make a decision by consensus. If no consensual agreement can be arrived at, the board makes a decision based on a simple majority vote.
2. **Implementation:** An approval for publication as a position of de-RSE e.V. is implemented either by merging and closing the respective issue or pull request and publication of the position on the website, or through an approval comment in and subsequent closing of the respective issue or pull request. If a position draft is not approved, the board can either return the draft to the authors for revision, and note this in the respective issue/PR together with indication of necessary changes, or reject the draft, and close the respective issue/PR with a suitable comment, in which case the position will not be published.
