# Werner von Bloh

I studied physics and got a PhD in theoretical physics at the Potsdam University.  I worked in the IT department of the Potsdam Institute of Climate Research (PIK) supporting  scientists to parallelize their programs. I am now a researcher at the Eatrh System Analysis department of PIK developing global vegetation models.
