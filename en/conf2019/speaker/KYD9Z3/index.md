# Ruben Sanchez

Dr. Rubén Sánchez Fernández is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the department of Computer Science at the Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany. In 2013, he graduated with honors in Civil Engineering from the University of A Coruña, Spain. He also worked there for 2 years as a Research Engineer in the Structural Mechanics Group, focused on experimental and computational aeroelasticity of bridge decks and also involved in the development of computational tools for industrial partners such as Airbus or Acciona. In July 2014, he moved to London, where he joined the department of Aeronautics at Imperial College to pursue his PhD under the supervision of Professor Rafael Palacios. His work there was focused on the development of coupled adjoint methods for sensitivity evaluation of Fluid-Structure Interaction problems in the open-source suite SU2, a community where he is a senior developer. He defended his thesis in November 2017 and moved to Kaiserslautern in April of 2018, where he continues working on the development of adjoint methods for multi-disciplinary problems within SU2.
