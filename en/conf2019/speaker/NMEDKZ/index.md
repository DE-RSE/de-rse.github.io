# Markus Töpfer

I am a Space Systems Engineer and Software Developer interested and working on topics of Systems Architecture, Systems Design, Full Stack Software Development and Engineering, Software Testing, Business Logic & API Design, DevOps and System Administration, User Interface Design, Human Computer Interaction, User Experience Research, Network Security, Telecommunication, Webtechnologies and Communication Protocols.
I like applied research, trial and error approaches, experimenting, improving all kind of things (humans, systems, concept, code ... ) as well as cybernetics. Usually I use convergence approaches to integrate different kinds of things (e.g. tools, processes, human aspects, concepts, technologies). Simplification and Prototyping are the defining conceptual approaches of my work.
I work for the German Space Operations Center and are initiator and leader of openvocs, a Mission Control Room Communication System.
