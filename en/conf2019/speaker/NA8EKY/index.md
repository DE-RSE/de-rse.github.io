# Tracy Kiszler

I am a graduate student in the Computational Sciences at the FU Berlin. My master has a strong focus on atmospherical modelling as I did my Bachelors degree in Meteorology (FU Berlin). As a part-time job I work at the IASS Potsdam where I am gaining some knowledge in the field of HPC.
