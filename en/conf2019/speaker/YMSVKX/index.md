I am a Ph.D. student at Julich Supercomputing Centre and Chemnitz University of Technology. In my Ph.D. project, I work on task graph scheduling for synchronization-critical applications on heterogeneous hardware. I studied computer science at Chemnitz University of Technology and received the M.Sc. in 2017.
