# deRSE19 - Call for Sponsors

A sponsorship of **deRSE19** is an ideal opportunity to introduce products and
services to the young and growing research software community in Germany, and
to step up as a champion of the German Research Software Engineering community
right from the start.

**deRSE19** is the first conference of its kind in Germany. It is modeled after
the three successful conferences that took place in the UK over the last three
years ([2016](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2016), [2017](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2017), [2018](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2018)),
at which sponsors had the possibility to present suitable offers and solutions
and products that are relevant for RSEs' work, and to enter into a dialogue
with RSEs and software development groups in research.

## Why sponsor deRSE19?

Together with the community of active RSEs, decision makers and research
funders, sponsors enable us to build and strengthen the RSE community in Germany.

The support of a conference allows sponsors to access a target group which is
essential in the decision-making in terms of usage of tools and services in science
and research.

Sponsors have the opportunity to engage directly with the Germany RSE community and
connect with the international community through cooperations.

Additionally, sponsors help to establish and promote the role of the Research
Software Engineer in Germany and internationally, to convey skills and best practices,
to promote a network and prepare everyone involved for the growing importance of
software for research.

Sponsors also allow for a more heterogeneous and inclusive conference audience by
helping us keep registration fees low through their financial support.

## deRSE19's audience

For **deRSE19**, we expect a diverse blend of around 200 RSEs, decision makers,
research funders, research scholars and Early Career Researchers to attend.
