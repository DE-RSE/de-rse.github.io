The bursaries have been endowed by the [UK Research Software Engineers Association](https://rse.ac.uk/).

### Application

To qualify for a UKRSE Bursary, you have to be based in the UK, and have an
accepted contribution to deRSE19.

To apply, please send a PDF to 
[konferenz@de-rse.org](mailto:konferenz@de-rse.org)
with the subject line "UKRSE Bursary".

The PDF should include:
- Your name, the name of the institution where you work/study, your position
- An extended abstract of your contribution (max. 500 words)
- The reasons for your application
- Whether you agree to be named as an awardee in case of acceptance

The deRSE19 Program Comitee will review the applications and make decisions
based on aspects of *contribution quality*, *diversity*, and *financial situation*.
If there are more positive reviews than bursaries, awards will be drawn randomly
(no recourse to legal action).

An initial deadline for applications is **31 March 2019**. If bursaries remain
available after the initial round of decisions, we will accept further
applications.

Awardees will be sent further details on acceptance.

## Further travel grants

We anticipate the installation of further travel grants, details to follow.
