## Volunteer Tickets

Running a conference requires a lot of helping hands. If you want to help us, buy a volunteer ticket or [contact us](contact.html). Volunteer tickets are for those who want to volunteer 50% of their time at deRSE19. More information about volunteering can be founde [here](volunteering.html).

## Financial Aid

See [travel grants](travel-grants.html).

As a community conference run by volunteers, we try to keep the ticket prices as low as possible. Therefore we are always looking for further [sponsors](sponsorship.html).
