# Help me help you

## [Tania Allard](../../speaker/8WXHNG/)

One of the core tasks of Research Software Engineers is to support researchers to produce reproducible, sustainable, and robust research. This, in the long turn, can lead to higher impact and better utilization of resources. But how can we (the RSEs) actively engage with the academic community and build long-lasting relationships for the improvement of research? How can we convince the wider academic or research body about the importance of RSEs?  In this talk, I will present a number of initiatives and approaches that have proved successful when building these RSEs-researchers and RSEs-department relationships for everyone’s benefit.
