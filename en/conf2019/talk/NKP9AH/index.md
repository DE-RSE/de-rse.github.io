# ediarum - from bottom-up to generic programming

## [Martin Fechner](../../speaker/J7DMYT/), [Stefan Dumont](../../speaker/X3KTPD/)

With ediarum, the TELOTA group of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities has been developing a working and publication environment for digital scholarly editions for several years. In contrast to similar projects, a bottom-up approach was chosen, i.e. the research environment was developed for the needs of individual scholarly editions projects. Due to the success of the research software, ediarum is used for more and more editions. This led to the change of the development model to a generic approach. The advantages and disadvantages of the development approaches and the organizational structure are discussed in the article.
