# Working Groups

Within the society, the rule of working groups is to coordinate and support project-related tasks and duties.
There are processes to help with the governance and work of the working groups.
Especially, we have processes in place to found and operate working groups.
The focus of those processes is to support required workflows while not restricting the actual work of the groups.

This page describes the processes and existing working groups.

## Definition of a Working Group

A working group:
- is defined by a reachable goal.
- consists of a group of interested people, who agreed to work together towards the prescibed goal.
  In special situations, it is possible to have a single person being the working group.
- defines itself to have a lifetime of at most one year.
- is led by at least one person.

## Cooperation of Society and Working Group

- The working group is brought to life by a resolution of the board.
  An informal request needs to be put forward to initiate the board's resolution.
- When the goal is reached but latests at the end of the lifetime, the working group presents it's results to the society.
  Preferrably, the results are presented using a blog post.
- The lifetime of a working group can be extended by the board upon informal request.
- Working group members are not required to be members of the society.
- All working groups are listed on the homepage of the society.
  It is also possible to advertise and communicate the contents of the working group on a seperate sub-space of the homepage.
- Working groups and their members agree to be published on the societie's public homepage.
  This holds true even if the working group has been terminated.

### AI4RSE <small>Lead: [Lukas Netz](https://www.se-rwth.de/staff/Lukas.Netz/)</small>

> The goal of the working group is to assess the current uses and challenges of AI in the context of RSE. This is done in three steps, starting with a survey within the scientific community to gain a broad overview of relevant focal points. The next step involves using the survey results to organize a workshop where key topics can be discussed in detail, and potential solutions and research topics can be developed. Finally, the insights and experiences from the first two steps will be summarized in a report or white paper and made available to the community.
