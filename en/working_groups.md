# Working Groups

Working groups within the association aim to help coordinate and advance work in projects.  
To ensure an orderly process, there are defined procedures for creating and operating working groups. You can find more information about these processes at the end of this page.

If you have an idea for a new working group and would like to establish one, send us an email at [vorstand@de-rse.org](mailto:vorstand@de-rse.org) and we’ll discuss the next steps with you. If you’d like to join an existing working group, you’ll find information below on how to get involved.

### AI4RSE <small>Lead: [Lukas Netz](https://www.se-rwth.de/staff/Lukas.Netz/)</small>

> The goal of the working group is to assess the current uses and challenges of AI in the context of RSE. This is done in three steps, starting with a survey within the scientific community to gain a broad overview of relevant focal points. The next step involves using the survey results to organize a workshop where key topics can be discussed in detail, and potential solutions and research topics can be developed. Finally, the insights and experiences from the first two steps will be summarized in a report or white paper and made available to the community.

**Get involved:** Contact [Lukas Netz](https://www.se-rwth.de/staff/Lukas.Netz/) or [Bernadette Fritzsch](https://www.awi.de/ueber-uns/organisation/mitarbeiter/detailseite/bernadette-fritzsch.html) to join the group.

## Definition of a Working Group

A working group:
- is defined by an achievable goal.
- consists of a group of interested individuals committed to that goal. In some cases, a working group may consist of just one person.
- sets its own duration.
- is led by at least one person.

## Relationship Between the Association and the Working Groups

- A working group is initiated by a board decision following an informal proposal.
- At the latest, upon reaching its goal or the end of its duration, the working group presents its results to the association, ideally as a blog post.
- The group lead should be a member of the association, though working group members do not need to be.
- Working groups are listed on the association’s website and may promote their work on subpages.
- Leads and members of working groups may be mentioned on the public pages of the association and give consent for this beyond the duration of the group.
